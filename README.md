# odin-recipes

My first odin project

I will be putting what I've learned about html into use for this project. 

Using strong, emphasised, unordered and ordered lists, as well as images and my ability to create an html boilerplate from scratch on my own.

This project is a basic recipe website featuring these elements and a webpage for each recipe.
