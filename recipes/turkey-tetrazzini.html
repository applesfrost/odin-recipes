        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe tastes just like Stouffer's® turkey tetrazzini. Best recipe I have found.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ⅔ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup sherry wine</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>½ (12 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
            <li>2 cups diced cooked turkey</li>
            <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish with 2 teaspoons butter.</li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>

            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir celery until it begins to soften, 1 minute. Stir mushrooms into celery; cook and stir until mushrooms are softened, 3 minutes more.</li>

            <li>Remove vegetables from skillet; melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter and whisk flour into hot butter to make a paste. Slowly whisk chicken broth and bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low and cook, whisking constantly, until sauce is thickened. Mix in cream, sherry, salt, and white pepper.</li>

            <li>Fold turkey, celery, and mushrooms into sauce; mix in angel hair pasta. Transfer mixture to prepared casserole dish and sprinkle panko crumbs on top.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and crumb topping has browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
